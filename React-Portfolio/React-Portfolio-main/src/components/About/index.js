        Hello! My name is TJ Tahmassebi. I am a student of The Ohio State University Coding Boot Camp and a graduate of the College of Engineering with my B.S. in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering. My dog's name is Morrison, I love learning new recipes to cook, and I currently have a 422-day streak on Duolingo learning Spanish with my mom.        </p>
        <p>
        My coding experience is mostly with MATLAB through my engineering coursework. I'm currently learning JavaScript in my coding bootcamp, as well as improving my skills with HTML and CSS. I am also familiar with C++, as I took a course on it in college. That's all on top of knowing SOLIDWORKS, ANSYS Fluent, TIG welding, landscaping and carpentry skills, and FL Studios (my SoundCloud link is at the bottom of the page). However, on this page I'm mostly focusing on my coding skills. Below you'll find a few of my favorite projects I've worked on. If you find them interesting feel free to contact me.</p>
